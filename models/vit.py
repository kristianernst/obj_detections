"""
Modern object detectors in general consist of a backbone feature extractor that
is agnostic to the detection task and a set of necks and heads that incorporate detection-specific prior knowledge.
"""

# so we need to build a backbone for the feature extractor.
# we can use a pretrained model here.
# we can use a custom head for the detection task.
